# Welcome to the Weather App contributing guide 

Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute to our project! :sparkles:

To make our community welcoming and respectable read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow. And that is from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

Read the [README](README.md) for an overview of the project. Here are some resources to get you started contributing to open source::

- [Finding ways to contribute to open source on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github)

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

- [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests)

## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find a problem in the code, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If you can't find a similar issue you can create one using the [issue form](https://github.com/lloydlobo/weather-app/issues/new/choose).


#### Solve an issue


Look over our [existing issues](https://github.com/lloydlobo/weather-app/issues) to see if there's anything that interests you. You can use 'labels' as filters to narrow down your search. For further information, see [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md). As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. You are welcome to open a PR with a fix if you find a workable issue.

### Make Changes

#### Make local changes

1. [Install Git LFS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-large-files/versioning-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage).

2. Fork the repository.

  - Using GitHub Desktop:

     - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.

     - You can [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop) after setting up the Desktop!

  - Using the command line:

     - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

3. Update or install **Node.js v16**. See [the development guide](contributing/development.md) for further details.

4. Create a working branch and begin with your changes!

### Commit your update

Once you're satisfied with the changes, Commit them. Check out [Atom's contributing guide](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-messages) to learn how to use emojis in commit messages.

To speed up the review process, don't forget to [self-review](/contributing/self-review.md) once your changes are ready. :zap:.

### Pull Request

After finishing the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

- Fill out the "Ready for review" template so that we may review your PR. This template aids reviewers in understanding your changes and the PR's purpose.

- If you're solving an issue, don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).

- To allow the branch for a merge, enable the checkbox for [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork).

After you submit your PR, a team member will examine it. We may inquire further or request more information.

- Before merging a PR, we may request more changes via [recommended changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-into-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply the recommended changes straight through the UI. You can make other changes in your Fork and then commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).


- If you run into any merge conflicts, check out this [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is now accepted and merged!
